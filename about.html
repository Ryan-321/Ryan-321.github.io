        I got interested in Web Development after looking for a career switch
        and asking myself what I really wanted.  My answers, I wanted to: learn a craft,
        build things(!), work with passionate people, give back and be creative.
        This site contains some of my past projects and experiences with technology.
        If you would like to get a hold of me, my info is below.
