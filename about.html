    <p>
      I got interested in Web Development after looking for a career switch
      and asking myself what I really wanted.  My answers: to learn a craft, build things(!), work with passionate people, give back and be creative. This site contains some of my past projects and experiences with technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a trained full-stack developer via General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course and have been honing my craft at my current job, which is in a Ruby on Rails and MySql environment.  My current side project is learning react, its tools and how and when to implement it. If you would like to learn more about I how can contribute to your team, please reach out to my e-mail below.
