I originally titled this post riding the learning curve, but I feel 'finding' is the more appropriate word.  The following post is about my experience through General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, in which I have spent the last 3 months learning to code.  

I came to GA with a little experience under my belt, after taking a part-time course in Web Design and Development at George Mason University.  Comparing the two courses, I would say GMU's was more design heavy (learning Adobe Suite, wireframing/layout) and introductory level HTML, CSS and JS; GA dropped me in the deep end of the code pool.  

The pre-work for GA covered most of what I learned at GMU code wise, going over basic HTML, CSS and JS syntax; then building a checkerboard with pieces in a Repl.  The first couple weeks in the course was a reenforcement of the pre-work, general overview of a developers environment and building up our front-end skills to an intermediate level.  My first project, a simple one-page [concentration](http://ryan-321.github.io/Memory/) game came quick and the two and half days we were given flew by.  My main feature was adding animation to the cards, giving each 3d perspective and showing them flip.

At that time I wasn't aware of the learning curve I was on, I was just having fun.  Looking back, I was sitting on top of the crest and getting ready to slide into the dip.  

Enter Ruby and Sinatra as our gateway into the MVC (model-view-controller).  Both were technologies I hadn't touched before and MVC a totally foreign concept.  I struggled that week.  I remember understanding in class and following along with the lesson plan, but when it came time for me to do my homework, I had a tough go.  That same week on Friday, our lab day, we were assigned to build a Instagram clone in Sinatra, a very simple Instagram clone. I teamed up with a fellow classmate and finally got it! Working through an application from start to finish with someone else, coming up with a plan, comparing processes, and talking through problems -  made it click. I had dug myself out of the pit of despair and saved all of humanity.  For the time being.  

For the next couple of weeks I went through this pattern, again and again.  I slogged my way through. But without any mechanics in place the road blocks started to pop up.  One of my biggest was expecting too much to work right away.  Coming from the first project where I was in my comfort zone, then going to no-man's (or women's) land, I had a disconnect with how much I should be progressing, how fast and in what order things should be working.  I was used to jumping in right away and getting pixels on the screen, instead of organizing my thoughts into tiny steps and incrementing my workflow like I had done with the Instagram clone.  I had gotten bogged down.  Bugs took longer to fix and I noticed I was more unaware of how things worked, simply because I was more focused on getting things done instead of 'how' to get things done.  Relying mainly on memorization to carry me though, not the underlying knowledge of how things worked, making it harder to problem solve.

Fed up, I made a list of what I was doing wrong.    

- I was being too hard on myself.  My advice, don't do this, it only leads to frustration. Coding is fun!  
- I wasn't asking 'why' enough.
- I wasn't taking the time build my foundation.  

Discovering I had been making the work harder on myself I needed to take a different approach, so I broke down my process.  I introduced Flash Cards (which I haven't used since college) to help me with the terminology, syntax and concepts I needed to grasp.  I started dissecting lesson plans and piecing together workflows that I could adhere to, instead of putting projects together with whatever came to mind.  Also, I chilled out. Programming is hard, no reason to expect the world of myself now.  What I really needed to concentrate on was building that firm foundation so my work in the future would be seamless and I could develop good habits to carry over into my professional life.  

With this new routine and mindset, I felt the difference.  I was gaining focus and having more fun.  I still had those moments where I was plopped into no-man's land, but I knew how to get myself out and back on track.

I thought about listing the technologies our class learned to give you some scope. If your interested you can look at my resume, there all there, most of them. What am getting at is not how much I learned, or was thrown at us, but how I coped with my development and being comfortable within a learning environment.  I didn't realize it until towards the end and I had experienced the ups and downs of the learning curve a couple of times, but once I did it really changed how I prepare myself.  Just accepting it as a process and realizing (not to be trite), but where I am today, is not where am going to be tomorrow.  

In closing, what I took away from GA's WDI course besides all the coding knowledge and people I met, was finding a learning curve.  With all the ups and downs of figuring out a framework in a week it's easy to misplace yourself and not be cognizant of your development.  Developing the habit of developing habits and just being aware of where you are in your development helped soo much down the stretch.  It gave me back my confidence and focus, and really set me up for future success.
