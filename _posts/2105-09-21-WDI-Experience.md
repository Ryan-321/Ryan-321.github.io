I originally titled this post riding the learning curve, but I feel 'finding' to be the more appropiate word.  As I explain my experience hopefully this will become more clear.  

I came to GA after having taken a part-time course in Web Design and Development at George Mason University.  In comparing the two courses, to give you an overview, GMU's was more design heavy(learning Adobe Suite, wireframing/layout) and introductory level HTML, CSS and JS; GA dropped you in the deep end of the code pool.  

The prework for GA covered most of what I learned in GMU's course, going over basic HTML, CSS and JS syntax; then building a checkerboard with pieces in the console.  The first couple weeks in the course was reenforcement of those concepts and building up our front-end skills.  My first project, a simple one-page [concentration](http://ryan-321.github.io/Memory/) game came easy to me and time flew by while I was working on it.  The main feature I wanted to tackled was being able to flip the cards over with a click event, which I did, and actually stumbled on to a way to throw the cards at when you win.  We had two and half days to work on the project, of which I was riding high on my learning curve and because of this didn't know I was on it.  The project was a mix of mostly old, but some new technology I knew, and, it was fast and fun.  

Enter Ruby and Sinatra.  

They introduced us to Ruby first, which was a shift in thinking, but as long as I could think in JS, then translate it to Ruby I was ok.  But once Ruby was staged, they hit us with Sinatra and the world of the MVC.  Then REst.  Then CRUD.
