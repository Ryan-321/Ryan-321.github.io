I originally titled this post riding the learning curve, but I feel 'finding' to be the more appropriate word.  As I explain my experience hopefully this will become more clear.  

I came to GA after taking a part-time course in Web Design and Development at George Mason University.  In comparing the two courses, I would say GMU's was more design heavy (learning Adobe Suite, wireframing/layout) and introductory level HTML, CSS and JS; GA dropped me in the deep end of the code pool.  

The pre-work for GA covered most of what I learned in GMU's course code wise, going over basic HTML, CSS and JS syntax; then building a checkerboard with pieces in a Repl.  The first couple weeks in the course was reenforcement of those concepts and building up our front-end skills to an intermediate level, just touching on JS objects.  My first project, a simple one-page [concentration](http://ryan-321.github.io/Memory/) game came quick and the two and half days we were given flew by.  My main feature was adding animation to the cards, giving each 3d perspective and showing them flip. I didn't know it at the time, but looking back I was sitting atop a big learning curve and getting ready to slide down into the dip.

Enter Ruby and Sinatra as our gateway into MVC(model-view-controller).  Both were technologies I hadn't touched before and MVC a total foreign concept.  I struggled that week.  I remember understanding in class and following along with the lesson plan, but when it came time for me to do my homework I had a tough time coming up with the answers.  That same week on Friday, our lab day, we were assigned to build a Instagram clone in Sinatra, a very simple Instagram clone; I teamed up with a fellow classmate and finally got it! Working through an application from start to finish with someone else, coming up with a plan, comparing processes, and talking through problems, made it click. I had dug myself out of the pit of despair and saved all of humanity.  For the time being.  

In the weeks that followed this became a familiar pattern, being in the weeds, given new technology and new patterns to learn, having them float in ether of my brain struggling to see the clouds form, and finally with effort, patience and collaboration; getting that ah-ha moment and starting to get into the focus of the work.

I thought about listing the technologies our class learned to give you some scope. If your interested you can look at my resume, there all there, most of them. What am getting at is not how much I learned, or was thrown at us, but how over time I learned to cope and realize where I was in my development and being comfortable with that.  I didn't realize it until towards the end and I had experienced the ups and downs of the learning curve a couple of times, but once I did it really changed my approach on how I prepare myself.  Just accepting it as a process and not trying to be trite, but where I am today, is not where am going to be tomorrow.  

I can't overstate this enough.
