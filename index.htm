				<h2>Life</h2>
				<p>Just a small town boy, living in a loooonely world!  Just kidding.  Born and raised and still living in the suburbs of DC.  
					My wife Nicole, the girl I took to my senior prom; just had our first child, Samantha.  We also have a dog, Lola, and cat, Angie.  I went to college at Virginia Wesleyan located in VA Beach, where I majored in Business.  
					I played basketball through college developing a work ethic, growing up in the sport. <span class="more" onmousedown="hideShow('extra1')">More</span></p>  
					
					<p id="extra1">I would say I am a people person, but am also independent, often waking up early while the house is quiet, so I can recharge. 
					I take this time to study and read fiction, a passion of mine.  I have always respected people with certain skills, not Liam Neeson, but painters, carpenters, architects, writers, etc.  This is why
					identify with Web Development, learning a skill I can use to create.</p>

				<h2>Work</h2>
				<p>I was a Mortgage Loan Processor for seven years.  It taught me multitasking, how to meet deadlines, attention to detail and gave me office experience.  
						I was good at this position, but intrinsically unfulfilled.  I am happiest when I can indulge my curiosity, have a change of scenery and work on something
						that can produce a tangible result. <span class="more" onmousedown="hideShow('extra2')">More</span> </p> 
						
						<p id="extra2">Numbers I plug into a spreadsheet at the end of the month before starting over again doesn't do it for me.  This was something I also experienced as a Merchandiser for a 
						wine distributor, my venture after loan processing.  I enjoyed the people I worked with, but it left me rudderless and with a sore back.  It was also something I jumped into too soon, happy for the change.
						I think with my new career path I have tested the waters sufficiently and am excited to get started.  More importantly I am excited to build, to give someone a product of my labor, a skill I took the time
						to learn, that they can use to their benefit.  I find that fulfilling.</p>

				<h2>Web</h2>
				<p>I looked into Web Development at the suggestion of a friend.  From there I took a Certificate course at George Mason University
				for Web Design and Development, which I obtained in September, and since, have been studying on my own, exploring different subjects in the field.  I found that I enjoy the coding
				aspect, looking behind the scenes and learning how webpages and apps have come to life. <span class="more" onmousedown="hideShow('extra3')">More</span></p>  
				
				<p id="extra3">I have also learned, doing it on your own, through books and online tutorials is difficult, 
				and I need the push of my peers and the classroom to focus and give myself direction.  I can let my curiosity get the better of me, letting myself get off task, 
				trying to learn something new instead of working on the project I was on.  Being in the classroom, having an objective or common goal will nullify that. 
				I believe I work better with someone looking over on my shoulder.  Just a little someone. </p>
