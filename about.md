  Hello and Welcome!  My name is Ryan Kahle and am a recent graduate of [General Assembly's](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive), Washington, D.C, Web Development Immersive program.  I am a full-stack web developer who loves design and is interested in building
  beautify web pages with efficient and well-thought out code.    

  I got interested in Web Development after looking for a career switch and asking myself what I really wanted.  My answers, to:

  - learn a craft
  - build things!
  - work with interesting people
  - give back
  - indulge my creativity

  This site contains some of my past projects and experiences with technology.  During the course I not only developed coding skills but also started breaking down how I learn best, and part of learning for me is writing.  Here I share my continuation of that process in the hopes that these blog posts prove useful to others and I can give back some of what I gained from other developers experiences.  s

  I currently live in Arlington, Va with my wife, daughter and crazy dog.  Please if you find anything interesting or have any questions, drop me a line.
